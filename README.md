# deeplearning-ocr-rnn
Final group project for FIU CAI4203. Combines OCR and RNN to create a handwriting to text model

After running and training the models, the last cell will output what lines should be manually reviewed, as predicted by the model.
The transcribed text will be found in the textfile "HTR_output.txt"
